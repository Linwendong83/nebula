/// The binding's decisions (create, update, release) are model logic and run in plain tests;
/// touching vanilla pools is the game adapter's job. Host pool indexes never cross this seam as raw
/// integers to be trusted — the <see cref="ObjectKey"/> carries identity and generation, and the
/// local slot is the host's <c>NativeId</c> installed at the same position (DESIGN 4.1), with
/// cursor/recycle maintained by the game adapter. The client never allocates an authoritative slot
/// on its own. Logic component ids (fleet/unit/drone/vehicle) stay zero on the shell, so the
/// vanilla fleet, targeting, ammo and destruction ticks skip it by construction.
