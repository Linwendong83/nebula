/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Vanilla pools recycle slots without a generation: when entity 7 is dismantled and a new building
/// takes slot 7, every stale reference to "entity 7" now names the new object. The authority
/// protocol cannot tolerate that — <c>ObjectKey.Generation</c> is what makes a recycled slot a new
/// identity instead of a resurrection — so the adapter mints generations itself. This tracker is
/// that mint, as a pure model type so the reuse rule is testable without a game process.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The rule is scan-shaped because the replicator's read is scan-shaped: the adapter reports every
/// occupied slot of one scan via <see cref="ObserveOccupied"/>, then closes the scan with
/// <see cref="EndScan"/>. A slot that was alive in the previous scan but is absent now is dead, and
/// its generation is retired — the next object to take the slot gets generation+1, never the dead
/// object's identity. A slot observed again within one scan is the same live object and returns the
/// same generation.
