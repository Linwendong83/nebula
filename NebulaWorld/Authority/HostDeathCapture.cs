/// Vanilla dies every damage-target class at exactly one place: <c>CombatStat.HandleZeroHp</c>
/// records the kill statistics and dispatches the per-kind <c>KillXxxFinally</c> (structure removal,
/// drops). On the host in authority mode that vanilla chain stays the rule — statistics and loot are
/// vanilla-delegated, executed once by the same call. What the vanilla chain does not do is the
/// authority bookkeeping: a tombstone per <see cref="ObjectKey"/>, one release of dependent
/// construction tasks, and dedup across every other source that reports the same death. This capture
/// supplies exactly that, by observing the death inside the vanilla prefix and committing it to
/// <see cref="HostDeathLedger"/> at the frame boundary.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The split follows DESIGN 6's threading rule. <see cref="Capture"/> runs wherever the vanilla rule
/// runs, including the parallel ground-unit and turret workers, so it only resolves the object's
/// identity (the pool slot is provably still occupied at this instant — by the frame boundary the
/// vanilla path has already removed it) and enqueues into a concurrent queue. <see cref="Drain"/>
/// runs at the quiescent frame boundary on the host thread, opens the ledger transactions, and
/// therefore commits the tombstone and the task release before the replicator's scan publishes the
/// frame's despawn.

/// Failure is counted, never guessed. An identity the resolvers cannot vouch for (unrealized
/// factory, unknown object type, a pool the key sources do not cover yet) is refused and counted —
